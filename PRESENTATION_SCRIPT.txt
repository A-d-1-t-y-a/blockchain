PRESENTATION SCRIPT: Decentralized Cloud Access Control
================================================================================

SLIDE 1: Title Slide
---------------------
"Hello everyone, my name is Ravi Teja Gandu. Today I present my research on 'Decentralized Cloud Resource Access Control Using FROST Threshold Signatures'."

SLIDE 2: The Problem
---------------------
"Traditional cloud access control relies on centralized authorities like AWS IAM. 
- Single Point of Failure: If IAM goes down, no one gets access.
- Centralized Trust: You must trust the cloud provider completely.
- Lack of Transparency: Audit logs are stored by the provider and can be tampered with."

SLIDE 3: The Solution
---------------------
"I propose a decentralized approach:
- Blockchain-Primary Authorization: Decisions are made by a distributed network.
- FROST Threshold Signatures: We use a 3-of-5 threshold scheme.
- Immutable Audit Trail: Every access decision is recorded on the blockchain."

SLIDE 4: System Architecture
---------------------
"The system has three layers:
1. Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts verify signatures and store policies.
2. Coordination Layer: An API Gateway manages FROST participants.
3. Cloud Layer: AWS resources (S3, EC2) are protected by this system."

SLIDE 5: Core Technology: FROST
---------------------
"We use FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signatures.
- Threshold (t=3, n=5): We have 5 participants.
- At least 3 must agree to sign an authorization request.
- This provides Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Up to 2 participants can be malicious or offline."

SLIDE 6: Implementation Details
---------------------
"I implemented the system using:
- Solidity for Smart Contracts (Access Control, Verifier)
- TypeScript/Node.js for the API Server
- Hardhat for local blockchain
- AWS SDK for cloud integration
- Merkle Trees for efficient policy storage"

SLIDE 7: Key Features Demo
---------------------
"Here are the key capabilities:
1. Decentralized Authorization: Blockchain decides access.
2. Multi-Cloud Support: Works with AWS S3, EC2, DynamoDB.
3. Gas Optimization: Consistent cost (~256k gas).
4. Hybrid Mode: Can work WITH cloud IAM for dual security."

SLIDE 8: Experimental Results
---------------------
"I conducted extensive testing with 18 API endpoints:
- Success Rate: 100% across all tests.
- Gas Usage: Extremely consistent (Variance < 0.01%).
- Response Time: Under 2 seconds.
- AWS Integration: Fully functional S3 uploads and IAM checks."

SLIDE 9: AWS Integration Proof
---------------------
"As shown in the screenshots:
- We integrated with a real AWS account (111236692387).
- We created real IAM users (Alice, Bob, Admin).
- We achieved 'Dual Approval' where both Cloud IAM and Blockchain authorized the request."

SLIDE 10: Conclusion
---------------------
"In conclusion, this research proves that we can decentralize cloud access control without sacrificing performance.
- We eliminated single points of failure.
- We created an immutable audit trail.
- We maintained compatibility with existing cloud providers."

SLIDE 11: Future Work
---------------------
"Future improvements could include:
- Layer 2 scaling (Arbitrum) to reduce gas costs.
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy.
- Support for Azure and Google Cloud."

"Thank you. I am happy to take questions."
